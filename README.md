# KnapsackProblem

"bigone.java" contains code to solve the knapsack problem.
Run the code by doing the following on the command line in Ubuntu 16.04.
1.javac bigone.java
2.java bigone

The code will tell you to enter a list of numbers. The order of numbers is important, because the first number is the sum, and the rest of the numbers are added up to equal the sum. The code will find all possible combinations of the numbers given to equal that sum. For example: if 20 11 9 10 10 20 is entered, then the code will print: 
11 9
10 10
20
Finding all such combinations in this way solves the Knapsack Problem.
